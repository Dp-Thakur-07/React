The Context API in React is a way to manage global state without needing to pass props manually at every level of the component tree. 
It helps avoid "prop drilling", where you pass data through multiple components unnecessarily.

ðŸ›  Steps to Use Context API:
Create a Context â€“ This is like a global storage for your data.
Provide the Context â€“ Wrap your components so they can access the data.
Consume the Context â€“ Read the data in any component that needs it.
