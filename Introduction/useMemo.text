ðŸ”¥ useMemo in React â€“ 
useMemo is a React Hook that optimizes performance by memoizing (caching) the result of a function so it doesnâ€™t get recalculated on every render.

ðŸ›  Why Use useMemo?
âœ… Prevents unnecessary calculations in expensive operations.
âœ… Improves performance by only recalculating when dependencies change.
âœ… Avoids re-rendering issues when passing computed values to child components.
